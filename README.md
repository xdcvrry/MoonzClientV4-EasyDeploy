Latest Version: V.4.0.1



## Features


Moonz is a user-friendly unblocked proxy site designed to provide seamless and secure access to restricted content on the internet. With its sleek and intuitive interface, Moonz offers users a reliable solution to bypass geo-restrictions and access websites and online services that may be blocked by local networks or government censorship.

Featuring advanced encryption technology, Moonz ensures that user data remains private and secure while browsing the web. Its high-speed servers located in strategic global locations guarantee smooth and uninterrupted browsing experience, allowing users to stream videos, access social media platforms, and browse the web with ease.

## Supported Sites

We run off of ultraviolet by using an Ultraviolet Bare Server, therefore the below sites are supported with ease.

- Google
- Youtube
- Spotify
- Discord
- Reddit
- GeForce NOW
- now.gg



## Deploying
You will need to deploy the public file for it to work, and if you need to edit it in something like vscode, you can use the vscode file attached. Remember to deploy the script.js and all of the uv files for it to work. It runs off the bare server of a site so change the bare server accordingly if the bare server is blocked
